# All purpose plot files

'All in one' is a plot file containing everything needed for setting up a plot. 

'Function' is for use within another file where the plot is called as a function.

'General' requires several library files for axis range, labels, etc. It's too tedious.

Recommend to use all in one. 

The data files(s) to plot are read in on the command line.
